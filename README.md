# pas2web3

pas2web3 is a SDK for creating decentralized web apps in [Embarcadero Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi).

pas2web3 is built upon [TMS Web Core](https://www.tmssoftware.com/site/tmswebcore.asp), a framework for creating modern web applications in Delphi.

pas2web3 is powered by [ethers.js](https://ethers.org) — a JavaScript library designed to enable developers to interact with the Ethereum blockchain and the larger Ethereum ecosystem.

Ethers.js is included with pas2web3 and as such you don’t need to download and install it. But you do need Delphi and TMS Web Core.
